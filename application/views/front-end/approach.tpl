                <p>The  elantara foundation believes that conservation must incorporate a harmony of principles that not only protect the interests of the people, particularly at the grass-roots level but also protect natural resources and bio-diversity long into the future- on a large scale   elantara believes all of the actors in a given ecosystem should communicate, collaborate and coordinate to manage a sustainable ecosystem, since a result of balance condition bet een long-term economic development, sustainable livelihoods for local communities, and environmental conservation  ill be bene cial for all of the stakeholders In Indonesia like elsewhere, forests are part of a mosaic that interconnects with other land uses such as agriculture and infrastructure - sometimes in a context of poverty, inequity and poorly planned economic development.</p>

                <p>This realization calls for prioritizing larger-scale, multi-stakeholder approach instead of sectoral silos and putting people on the same footing as environmental values, therefore, encouraging new and innovative ways for the conservation of ecosystems. Central to Belantaraâ€™s approach is facilitating multi- stakeholder forum from the ground up. Through the forum, the stakeholders centered within the ecosystem are enabled to design a conservation plan that is long-term and sustainable but also supports their economic needs. It put local communities, government authorities,    s, and businesses as the key actors for the change.</p>
